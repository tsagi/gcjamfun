Thanks [nitsas](https://github.com/nitsas/codejamsolutions) for the template files and all that helpful stuff.

- All ".in" files are input files. Just run runme.py on them and they'll 
  generate the expected output.
- You can download expected output files (and larger input files) from the 
  Google Code Jam practice page.
- I'll be adding more problems as I solve them.
